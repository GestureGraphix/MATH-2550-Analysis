  Let $F$ be any ordered field (for example $F = \bbQ$ or $F = \R$).
  Suppose $A \subset F$ has a supremum. Suppose $\eps \in F$
  with $\eps > 0$. 
  Prove that there exists some $x \in A$ such that $x > (\sup A) - \eps$.
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  $A$ having a supremum means that there is some $y \in F$ that is a least upper bound for 
  $F$ such that for any upper bound $y' \in F$, $y \leq y'$. Yet for all $x \in A$, $x \leq y$. \\
  Let us suppose that the statement is false. That would mean that $\forall x \in A$, $x \leq (\sup A) - \epsilon$, wehre $\epsilon \geq 0$ \\
  Letting $\sup A = y$ this would mean that there exists some uppwer bound $y - \epsilon < y$, since $\epsilon > 0$. 
  Which contradicts the statement that $y$ is a upper bound of $A$ such that for all other upper bounds, $y'$ $y \leq y'$ Meaning the statement is true.

\qs{}{
  Let $A \subset \R$ be nonempty and bounded below. Define
  \begin{equation}
  -A = \{-x\ \mid x \in A\} \, .  
  \end{equation}
  Prove that $\inf A = - \sup(-A)$.
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  The infimum of $A$ is a number $y \in \R$ such that $y$ is a lower bound for $A$ and for any other lower bound $y'$ of $A$ we have $y' \leq y$. The supremum of a set $B$ is a number $z \in \R$ such that $z$ is an upper bound for $B$ and for any other upper bound $z'$ of $B$ we have $z \leq z'$. 
  
  $-A$ is defined by multiplying each element of $A$ by $-1$. In $\R$, if $x < x'$ and $c < 0$ then $xc > x'c$, so the order is reversed when we pass from $A$ to $-A$. That means every lower bound of $A$ becomes an upper bound of $-A$, and conversely. In particular, the greatest lower bound of $A$ corresponds to the least upper bound of $-A$ under this reversal.
  
  So let $y = \inf A$. Then for all $x \in A$ we have $y \leq x$, which is equivalent to $-x \leq -y$ for all $x \in A$. This shows $-y$ is an upper bound of $-A$. 
  
  Now suppose $u$ is any other upper bound of $-A$. Then for all $x \in A$ we have $-x \leq u$, which means $x \geq -u$. Thus $-u$ is a lower bound of $A$, and since $y$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$ we have $-u \leq y$. Rearranging gives $u \geq -y$. Therefore $-y$ is the least upper bound of $-A$, so \ $\sup(-A) = -y$. 
  
  So
  \[
  \inf A = -\sup(-A).
  \]

  Suppose $A, B \subset \R$ are both nonempty and bounded above.
  Define the set $A+B$ by
  \begin{equation}
    A + B = \{a+b \mid a \in A, b \in B\} \, .
  \end{equation}
  Prove that $\sup(A + B) = \sup A + \sup B$.
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  The supremum of a set is a number $x$ in the set such that $x$ is a lower bound for the set and any lower bound 
  $x'$ for the set has $x \leq x'$. $\R$ is an ordered field meaning that if follows the order axiom 
  that means that if $a < b$ and $c < d$ then $a + b < c + d$. $A$ and $B$ are both subsets of the ordered field 
  $R$ meaning that they also have an ordering. So that if $a, a'$ are in $\R$ and $b,b'$ are in $\R$ with $a < a'$ and $b < b'$ it follows that $a + b < a' + b'$ 
  by the order axiom of fields so for all $x \in \R$ there exists some least upper bound $q$ such that 
  $\forall x \in A$, $x \leq q$ and the same applies for $B$. Following the order axiom that means that $q + p \geq a + b$ for 
  all $ a + b \in A, B$

\qs{}{
  Suppose $F$ is an ordered field and $x, y, z \in F$.
  \begin{enumerate}
      % \item Prove that $0<1$.
      \item Prove that if $x>0$, then $x^{-1}>0$.
      \item Prove that if $x>0$, then $y>z$ if and only if $xy>xz$.
      \item Recall the field $\mathbb{F}_3 =\{0,1,2\}$ which we discussed in class. Prove that there does not exist an order on $\mathbb{F}_3$ such that it is an ordered field.
  \end{enumerate}
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  1. Let $F$ be an ordered field and let $x>0$. Because $F$ is a field, there exists
  $x^{-1}\in F$ with $x\cdot x^{-1}=1$, and $x^{-1}\neq 0$.
  Assume for contradiction that $x^{-1}\le 0$. Since $x^{-1}\neq 0$, we have $x^{-1}<0$.
  In an ordered field, multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the
  inequality; hence from $x>0$ we obtain
  \[
  x\cdot x^{-1} \;<\; 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad 1<0.
  \]
  But in any ordered field every nonzero square is positive, so $1=1^2>0$, a contradiction.
  Therefore $x^{-1}>0$. \\

  2. Let $x>0$. First suppose for contradiction that $y<z$ but $xy > xz$.  
  Since $x^{-1}>0$ by part (1), multiplying both sides of $xy > xz$ by $x^{-1}$ preserves the inequality:
  \[
  xy > xz \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; x^{-1}(xy) > x^{-1}(xz) 
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; (x \cdot x^{-1})y > (x \cdot x^{-1})z
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; y > z,
  \]
  contradicting $y<z$.
  
  For the other direction, suppose for contradiction that $y>z$ but $xy < xz$. Multiplying both sides by $x^{-1}>0$ preserves the inequality:
  \[
  xy < xz \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; x^{-1}(xy) < x^{-1}(xz)
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; (x \cdot x^{-1})y < (x \cdot x^{-1})z
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; y < z,
  \]
  contradicting $y>z$.
  
  Hence $y>z \iff xy > xz$.

  This exercise is a reminder that the ``size'' of infinite sets can
  be a bit counterintuitive.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
  Suppose $a, b \in \R$, with $a < b$.
  Prove that there is a bijection from $(a,b)$ to $(0,1)$.

  \item Prove that there is a bijection from $(0,1)$ to $(1,\infty)$.

  \item Suppose $a,b \in \R$. 
  Prove that there is a bijection from $(a,\infty)$ to $(b,\infty)$.
  \end{enumerate}
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $(0,1)$ be a subset of $\R$ that inherits its conventional ordering this means that $0 < 1$. A bijection 
      There is a bijection if there is both a surjection a injection
